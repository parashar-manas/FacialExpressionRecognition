## Introduction

This project is a deep learning-based facial expression recognition system implemented using PyTorch. It can classify facial expressions into seven different emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. The project includes the following components:

- Dataset preparation
- Model training
- Inference and visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (>=3.x)
- PyTorch (>=1.x)
- Dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. Clone the Facial Expression Dataset repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parth1620/Facial-Expression-Dataset.git
   ```

2. Install or upgrade the Albumentations library using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -U git+https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations
   ```

3. Install the 'timm' library, which provides pre-trained models and model building utilities:

   ```bash
   pip install timm
   ```

4. Upgrade or install the OpenCV library with the contrib package:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade opencv-contrib-python
   ```

5. Install other project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Dataset

To use the Facial Expression Recognition system, you'll need to prepare your dataset or use an existing one. Organize your dataset into training and validation sets and configure the dataset paths in the code.

### Training

1. Set the desired hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs) in the script.

2. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. Monitor the training progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

### Inference

1. To perform inference on new images, you can use the trained model.

2. Load the model weights using `torch.load`.

3. Preprocess your image (resize, normalize) and pass it through the model for inference.

4. Visualize the results using the provided visualization functions.
